In any case if you use material not from your (partner) country and characterise this physically e.g, metabolites, proteome, biochemically RNASeq etc this might represent a Nagoya relevant action unless this is from e.g. US (non partner), Ireland (not signed still contact them) etc but other laws might apply&hellip;. #endissuewarning</span>
